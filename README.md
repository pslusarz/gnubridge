GNUBridge is a Contract Bridge program written in Java and available under GNU public license v. 3.

Note, there haven't been any updates to this project for awhile.

##Users:
There's no distribution provided, so you can either build yourself a jar with '%./gradlew build' and run as executable jar or run directly with './gradlew run'. 

##Developers
Need a minimum of Java 1.5. Builds with Gradle wrapper (ie: %./gradlew build). Need at least 1Gb to run (more is better), so in IDE you need to pass a VM option -Xms1024M. This is already configured for gradle wrapper.
